# Chest X-ray Classification Project

## Overview
Welcome to the Chest X-ray Classification Project!🌟 This project focuses on leveraging deep learning techniques to classify chest X-ray images into "normal" and "abnormal" categories. The project utilizes the Fastai library, a powerful and user-friendly deep learning library, to streamline the development process.🚀

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following key components:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:📂** Chest X-ray images were gathered from various sources, ensuring a diverse and representative dataset. Images were preprocessed, including resizing and normalization, to prepare them for model training.

2. **Model Development:🤖** A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture was constructed using the Fastai library, specifically incorporating the ResNet34 pre-trained model. This choice was made for its ease of use, rapid prototyping capabilities, and the magic of transfer learning.

3. **Training and Evaluation:🚀** The model was trained on the prepared dataset, and its performance was evaluated using validation metrics to ensure accuracy and reliability.

4. **Deployment:🌐** The trained model is ready for deployment, allowing seamless classification of new chest X-ray images with high accuracy and efficiency.

## Women Who Code Challenge💪👩‍💻

This project aligns with the Women Who Code challenge, encouraging participants to create their image classifiers on Google Colab notebook. Join the conversation on #WWCode and #deeplearning, and share your results to showcase your achievements!
